Please follow below steps to install DHCP service on Ubuntu 22.04 

apt-get update

apt-get install isc-dhcp-server

Once installed if you try to start the service you will get below error

No subnet6 declaration for eth0.
 ** Ignoring requests on eth0.  If this is not what
 you want, please write a subnet6 declaration
 in your dhcpd.conf file for the network segment
 to which interface eth0 is attached.

If you get above error, please open the dhcp conf file /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

Give the subnet declaration for the eth0 like below

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
   interface eth0;
   option routers 8.8.8.8;
}

Once subnet was provided, please restart the services then the dhcp service will work

systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server.service

After service was started, please provide the loop for which dhcp required like below

subnet 172.27.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
   range 172.27.1.0 172.27.1.250;
   default-lease-time 3600;
   max-lease-time 3600;
   option routers 172.27.1..254;
   option domain-name-servers 172.27.1.10, 8.8.8.8; 
}

Once pool was created we can check the leases in the below file

/var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases

Allowing the required segments will be taken care by Network team
